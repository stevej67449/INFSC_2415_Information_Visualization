					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<p>Regional Intergovernmental Organizations (RIGOs) are constituted by the local governments within their respective regions and are supported by the active engagement of the region’s community and citizens. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), on the other hand, are classified by the federal government based on commuting and commerce patterns. They do not adhere to any local government. The Graduate School of Policy and International Affairs Center for Metropolitan Studies (GSPIA) at the University of Pittsburgh have been researching the boundaries of RIGOs and the characteristics defining them. Last year, they partnered with students studying Information Visualization to create a visualization that compares the boundaries of RIGOs and MSAs. This semester, we are enhancing the previous year’s visualization according to requirements prioritized by GSPIA. In this paper, we describe our current approach and progress toward these efforts.</p>
